Theories and practical applications of statistical and machine learning methods for predicting and simulating temporal data, including time-series forecasting and data modeling.


Predicting and Simulating Temporal Data

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on applying statistical and machine learning methods to data with temporal dependencies. The examples demonstrate both theoretical concepts and practical approaches for analyzing time-dependent data.
Contents

    HMM_Viterbi_Algorithm.ipynb: Demonstrates how the Hidden Markov Model(HMM) works theoretically for predicting temporal data.
    Generate_Data_with_an_HMM.ipynb: Simple weather prediction example by using HMM
    Named_Entity_Recognition.ipynb: NER is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that consists in identifying and classifying names of entities 
    CRF_model.ipynb: Averaged perceptron usage(Conditional Random Field) example for the NER problem to get better convergence


Topics Covered:

    HMM, Viterbi Algo, Forward-Backward Algo
    NER
    CRF (check for more on this medium article: https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/named-entity-recognition-ner-using-conditional-random-fields-in-nlp-3660df22e95c)
    

How to Use:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/armagankaymaz/ML-exercises-1.git

    Install necessary dependencies by following the instructions in each notebook.

About

These notebooks were created as part of my study and research on statistical methods and machine-learning techniques for temporal data.
