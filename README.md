Theories and practical applications of statistical and machine learning methods for predicting and simulating temporal data, including time-series forecasting and data modeling.


Predicting and Simulating Temporal Data

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on applying statistical and machine learning methods to data with temporal dependencies. The examples demonstrate both theoretical concepts and practical approaches for analyzing time-dependent data.
Contents

    ex_solution4.ipynb: Demonstrates [specific method or topic] for predicting temporal data.
    ex_solution5-NER.ipynb: Focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) with temporal analysis.

Topics Covered:

    Time-series forecasting
    Temporal data simulation
    Statistical modeling
    Machine learning for time-dependent data

How to Use:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/armagankaymaz/ML-exercises-1.git

    Install necessary dependencies by following the instructions in each notebook.

About

These notebooks were created as part of my study and research on statistical methods and machine-learning techniques for temporal data.
